          so important? They are an integral part of cell membranes throughout the body and affect the function of the
          cell receptors in these membranes.*

        <h3>Superfruits</h3>

          substances found only in certain plants, and antioxidants are supposed to rid our bodies of potentially
          harmful oxidized agents which can damage cells. While our bodies do naturally produce antioxidants, consuming
          a combination of super fruits is a great way to support optimal antioxidant levels.*

        <h3>Fiber</h3>
        <div class="ingredients-description">
          Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body can't digest. Though most carbohydrates are broken down into
          sugar molecules, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body
          undigested. Fiber helps regulate the body's use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in check. It
          is considered less "energy dense," which means it has fewer calories for the same volume of food.*
